# FastAPI-Data-Cleaning-API
A FastAPI service that reuses his project reuses transformation logic from [python-data-pipeline](https://github.com/Deski9/python-data-pipeline)..  The API accepts a CSV file and a JSON configuration, applies modular transformations, and returns a cleaned dataset as either a downloadable CSV or a JSON preview.
